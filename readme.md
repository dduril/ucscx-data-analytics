### UCSC Extension - Database and Data Analytics Certficate

Courses from the **[Database and Data Analytics Curriculum](https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/programs/database-systems/schedule)** offered by the University of Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley. Having obtained extensive experience working in web applications development, systems integration and relational database systems, I recently chose to re-focus on Big Data and Data Engineering. My course work at UCSC Silicon Valley will allow me to specialize in the following areas: Data Analysis process and tools, Big Data (Hadoop and Spark), Cloud (AWS), IoT, NoSQL (MongoDB), and Data Visualization (Tableau).
